# William Wheeler Personal Site
<p>This is my personal website I built to emulate an old desktop <i>(vaguely Apple II though I realize the Apple II wouldn't have taken the small hard floppys pictured).</i></p>

<p>Check out the live site
<a href="https://williamwheelerworkshop.com/"> here. >>></a>

## Floppy Navigation
<hr>
<p> You can navigate the page by clicking the labeled floppy disks which will then "slot in" to the terminal below. </p>
<p>To view another section, just click another floppy or hit the "eject" button to turn off the terminal.</p>

## Mobile Terminal
<hr>
<p>Check out the mobile terminal (specifically the "Skills" floppy) for a little more retro experience. </p>
